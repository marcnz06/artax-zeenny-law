`email-verify-email.html`: Page where the administrator is warned that an email with a verification link has been sent to the user's inbox.  
`email_confirmation_email.html`: Email content sent to users' inboxes to verify their email address.  
`email_confirmation_invalid.html`: Link for verification not valid.  
`email_confirmed.html`: Link valid and account verified.  
`faq.html`: A page where administrators can insert useful commonly asked questions with their respective answers  
`layout.html`: Base template of this website with sidebar, header, footer...  
`login.html`: Login page of all users.  
`new-book.html`: Template that lets users add records to the database.

## Installation

NB: Be sure to have `python` and `pip` installed to be able to run the web server.

1. Unzip the project.
2. In your terminal, `cd` into the zeennylawfirm-harvard directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all python modules.
4. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` auctions to make migrations for the auctions app. 
5. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations to your database.
6. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the onscreen instructions to create a superuser. The latter will be needed to be able to access basic Artax features.
7. Run `python manage.py runserver` to activate your development server. You can also run `python manage.py runserver --insecure` with `debug=False` to be able to view the custom-made 403, 404... error pages without the need to have a production server set up.


## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project represents a significant departure from standard course assignments and represents a unique combination of complexity and innovation. Its uniqueness lies in several key aspects that distinguish it  from  other projects in the course:

### Distinctiveness

Users accounts are first created by an administrator (more on that below) where first name, last name, email address, password and clearance are required. 
As information security is a game changer in a law firm system, the clearance field is a very important part of the web app. Indeed, there are 4 clearance level for users.  

- Visitor (View and Review any book record.)
- Lawyer (View, review and alter any book record.)
- Office Administrator (View, review, alter add and delete any book record in addition to user management and access to the admin panel)
- System Administrator (Unrestricted access to all data and functionality within the application as well as having the highest level of control and authority within the Django project)

!['Login'](Screenshots/login.png)
!['Register'](Screenshots/register.png)

After a thorough client-side verification (with javascript) and then a deeper server-side verification(python in the backend), an nicely formatted email is sent to the email address specified with a link containing a unique token, to be used for verification. 
If verification is successful, the user is redirected to his profile where he can edit additional fields such as phone number, job, description...
The limit of his actions is determined by his clearance.

Users actions are also logged in 3 different files in the `logs` directory: `app.log` is where all errors are written, `books.log` for every action related to the books table beginning with adding a new record to editing it and finally deleting and finally `users.log` where all users actions like logging in, logging out... are recorded and timestamped accordingly.

Technologies used in this project:
- Django
- JavaScript
- HTML + CSS
- Bootstrap
- Django QR Codes
- Logging


## Purpose

This web app is a content management system, and more specifically a book management system custom-made for law firms.
It encompasses everything needed to have a good, performing and reliable system. 
Let's take for example a user named Marc with system administrator privileges:
1. Marc can add books to the database by going to `/books/new-record/`. He will be prompted by a well-designed form with Bootstrap with proper user experience and validation.
The model Book (defined in models.py) comes into play where it logs 
With security in mind, he can upload a book summary as a scanned file (with pdf as the only supported file type) and a book cover (with limited photo types).
There is also the book location, type, language and author who are stored in the database as foreign keys. To add manage those fields, an administrator can just go to the admin panel. He will be able to add any object he wants.
A special ID (lib_id field) is automatically generated by combining the type code of each book type with the ID of each book given its type. So if we have 5 book of type commercial, the 6th one will have a special ID of FIN6.
A QR Code for each record is also generated by dynamically generating the url that will take the user to the record.
!['New Book'](Screenshots/new_book.png)
2. Each record has its own dedicated page by simply going to `books/<x>/` where `x` is the auto-number generated (!= lib_id). Marc can view the books details, or download the books QR Code. He can also add and/or edit data related to the record. Indeed, he can modify 10 of the 19 book fields manually. Moreover, he can add or delete any of the book's cover or summary very easily.  
!['Book Record'](Screenshots/book.png)
3. Marc will also be able to delete any record he would like by simply going to the "Delete Record" tab, pressing on the "Proceed" button, and finally "Delete Permanently" in the delete pane.
4. In addition to view, adding and deleting, the user can query the database by going to `books/queries/`. He will be asked to make a choice between being redirected to the exact record by entering the ID or Special ID on one hand, or entering data in a Multi Filter Form. The latter will enable the user to limit the dataset he is searching in and finding the appropriate record in record time.

The capstone project is simply miles away of any other project made in this course.
Here are few of the goals and objectives set and achieved in this project:

- Stability (easy postgres integration).
- Good-looking, practical and well thought of design + mobile responsive.
- Optimized for small to medium scale law firms.
- Security (CSRF, Email verification, SQL Injection...).
- Maintainable (Django)
- User experience (JavaScript)

**Artax mobile responsive UX:**

## In-Depth Documentation
In addition to its technical complexity, this project also stands out for its comprehensive documentation. The README.md file you are currently reading is just one aspect of many ongoing documentation efforts. This is a testament to the dedication and commitment to ensuring that users and potential collaborators have all the information they need to understand and effectively use this unique system.

## Project's future

This Django project was a priority for me, and I worked on it to achieve perfection because of my plans for its future. Indeed, I intend to deploy this web app as an intranet in my dad's law firm, named Zeenny Law.
<img src="Screenshots/deploy.JPG" width="250" alt="Deployment">  
(A picture of me downloading packages and software on a Windows server, in the early stages of deploying the intranet.)  
For the future, I also plan to add a client, file and accounting managing system. The three are essential components of law firm work and management.


In short, this capstone project goes  beyond  course requirements to provide a complex, industry-specific solution. It reflects a deep understanding of the challenges facing law firms and leverages cutting-edge technologies to solve them. The complexity and uniqueness of this project is evident in its specialized features, meticulous security measures and comprehensive documentation.
To complete this website, it took me as much time as all the other projects combined.
I learned new technologies, didn't limit myself to what I learned in the course and pushed the boundaries of what a Capstone Project can be.
